        ## First GBM Outdoor Social

        *September 8th, 2024*

        After our first GBM, we held a new member social in the courtyard, featuring outdoor games like Frisbee, Spike Ball, and ring toss. Snacks and refreshments were provided, creating an opportunity for new members to connect. The event concluded with a Frisbee circle, where everyone shared their names and got to know each other.

        ## Subteam Volleyball Competition

        *September 28th, 2024*

        We held a volleyball match as the first installment in our ongoing intra-subteam competition, pitting the mechanical subteam against the electrical and computer subteams. After a hard-fought and intense game, the electrical and computer subteams emerged victorious. Having Brian and Winston on the same team was a scary combo, and even though they were throwing a bit, mechanical was throwing harder, costing them the win. Mehcniacal needs a lot of practice if they ever want to rival the compueter/electrical volleyball powerhouse.

        *October 5th, 2024*

        During Young Alumni Reunion Weekend, recent MARS graduates returned to Grounds to reconnect with former teammates and meet the new generation of MARS engineers. Despite a lengthy chicken shenanigans, we managed to secure Cane's chicken for the team, which everyone thoroughly enjoyed.

        ## Sabrina Carpenter Concert Concessions

        *October 20th, 2024*

        When Sabrina Carpenter's Sweet and Sour Tour came to Charlottesville for a sold-out show, MARS took the opportunity to run concessions. Leading up to the event, we prepped by memorizing the setlist, and during the show, we managed to sneak off occasionally to catch glimpses of the performance. Running the booth was a fun experience as we handled cashiers and managed the front-of-house food stands. To top it off, we even got to take home a giant tray of chicken tenders!

        *October 26th, 2024*

        For our second concessions day, we headed to Scott Stadium to run a booth during the football game. What made this event unique was that we were the only ones there, with no other employees or managers to assist us. We handled everything ourselves, making on-the-spot decisions as the game unfolded.

        ## Pumpkin Painting

        *October 27th, 2024*

        In the spirit of Halloween, MARS hosted its now-annual pumpkin painting event, continuing our series of intra-subteam competitions. After the GBM, everyone gathered in the Lacy MARS room, picked out a pumpkin, and began painting their designs. Once finished, we voted on the best pumpkins. Mechanical took home the prize for best large pumpkin with Nayeon and Criag's Buc-ee's design, while Electrical won best small pumpkin with Swedha's Phineas and Ferb pumpkin.

        ## Spooky Movie Night

        *October 30th, 2024*

        In the spirit of Halloween, MARS hosted its first annual spooky movie night, featuring The Blair Witch Project. While it wasn’t as terrifying as anticipated, it was a great time watching and unraveling the mysterious storyline together. While most of us remained unfazed, Craig was absolutely petrified during the night scenes.

    ## MARSGIVING

    *November 20th, 2024*

    Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, MARS hosted its own version of Friendsgiving—Marsgiving! This event is widely considered the favorite social gathering among MARS members. We kicked off the night by preparing a delicious Thanksgiving spread, including mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, stuffing, and warming up store-bought turkey. The evening was filled with shenanigans, including a cheap vs. expensive mac and cheese contest and trolling Craig until he cracked. We wrapped up the night with an epic karaoke session, singing our hearts out and blasting our favorite songs at full volume.

## Scary Movie + Concessions

*November 23rd, 2024*

We had a 2nd scary movie night where we watched Smile:) late into the night, followed by another football concessions session the following morning.

        ## Gingerbread House Contest

        *Dec 8th, 2024*

        To get into the holiday spirit, we held a gingerbread house-making contest. After the GBM, MARS members paired up and took on the challenge of assembling the best gingerbread house using a kit. This event was part of our ongoing intra-subteam competition (voting is still ongoing). While many houses turned out beautifully, the Chris and Ryan duo was specially chaotic.

        In the spirit of the holidays, we gathered over two nights during finals week to watch Home Alone 1 and 2. After the movies, we spent time doom scrolling together, connecting our Instagram Reels feeds to the giant tv, letting ourselves doomscroll together before getting back to the studying grind.

        ## Basketball Game Concessions

        *Dec 8th, 2024*

        For our final concessions shift of the semester, we headed to John Paul Jones Arena to run concessions for the men's basketball game. It was a typical shift, but with the twist that the two MARS teams were stationed in competing stands on the 100-level section. This gave us a unique advantage with a monopoly, but also sparked a friendly competition to see who could sell the most. We ended the night with a massive haul of leftover concessions food, which Craig, Ben, Jordan, and Gabe seized the opportunity to create a glizzy tribute.
